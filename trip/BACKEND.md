# Trip Backend Contract

This document describes the backend contract that the Trip workspace should respect.

Code lives in `../backend/`. Runtime and setup details live in:

- `../backend/README.md`
- `../backend/LOCAL_DEV.md`
- `../HANDOFF.md`

## Core Rule

Decision policy is backend-owned.

Frontend may present, draft, or preview a change, but it must not own final destination
policy, session identity, or decision-path classification.

## Decision Paths

Current backend decision outcomes are:

- `notice`
- `round`
- `reopen_round`
- `confirm`

### Path Meaning

| Path | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `notice` | Apply immediately and create an anonymous update notice. |
| `round` | Open a decision round. The current plan stays unchanged until settlement. |
| `reopen_round` | Reopen a settled slot with a stricter vote requirement and written reason. |
| `confirm` | Create a confirmation proposal for affected members only. |

### Classification Priority

The authoritative decision logic lives in:

- `../backend/app/domain/constraints/engine.py`

The general priority is:

1. hard blockers first
2. reopened settled decisions next
3. contested or touched slots next
4. direct notice last

### Settledness Model

Each plan item has a backend-owned settledness state:

- `loose`
- `touched`
- `settled`
- `booked`

Those states affect whether a future change can go straight through, must open a round,
must reopen a round, or must go to confirm.

## Roles

Roles are trip-scoped through `TripMembership`.

| Capability | Organizer | Participant | Guest |
| --- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| View plan | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Submit preferences | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Propose changes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Vote or confirm | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| View members | Yes | No | No |
| Create invites | Yes | No | No |
| Handle deadlock exit | Yes | No | No |

Non-negotiable rules:

- organizer preference weight is not higher than anyone else's
- organizer cannot read private preference wording
- organizer cannot act as a super-user and pick one side's proposal for the group

## Privacy

Privacy is structural.

Private wording must not leak through "best effort" filtering only. The system separates:

- raw private wording
- safe decision data
- group-visible updates

Frontend should assume that safe backend payloads are already anonymized by type and should
not try to reconstruct private identity from local state.

## Key Entities

Important backend entities include:

- `User`
- `Trip`
- `TripMembership`
- `InviteLink`
- `Preference`
- `MemberConstraint`
- `MemberConstraintPrivate`
- `Plan`
- `PlanItem`
- `PlanChange`
- `DecisionRound`
- `Vote`
- `ChangeProposal`
- `ProposalDecision`
- `UpdateNotice`

### Important Notes

- `PlanChange` is the append-only ledger for itinerary change history
- `PlanItem` carries canonical schedule information used by the current plan view
- moving an item across dates must keep `day_date` and `day_index` consistent
- current plan day headers should come from canonical trip-window dates, not stale item data

## Initial Plan Generation

`POST /api/trips/{tripId}/plans/generate` is backend-owned.

Current behavior includes:

- organizer prerequisite checks
- refusal to overwrite existing plan items
- deterministic validation around constraints and schedule legality
- planner fallback behavior
- blocked-state reporting
- Planner model output identifies Place Library candidates by `candidate_id`; the backend,
  not the model, resolves canonical English/local names into `PlanItem`
- normal full-day planning prioritizes hard constraints, fixed/locked events, availability,
  opening hours, geography, transitions, meal timing, interests, and variety in that order
- lunch and dinner remain backend-added anchors; route-aware selection tries restaurants at
  progressively wider bounded radii, then meal-specific relaxed categories, and uses an honest
  flexible break only as the final fallback; dinner excludes café-only venues
- `PlanItem.is_meal` and derived `meal_type` are returned by the current-plan API so Trip renders
  `LUNCH` and `DINNER` separately from the sightseeing sequence
- each day receives a distance-aware candidate neighborhood; ordering uses straight-line
  coordinate distance only and does not claim provider routing or walking time
- Place Service ranks clear, category-specific, travel-relevant names inside the existing
  category round-robin and spatial-spread structure, with reliable address information as an
  additional within-category signal
- safely parseable provider opening hours reject known-closed candidates; missing or unsupported
  hours stay unknown, and optional evening stops require explicit evening suitability
- saving a preference or constraint never rewrites current items; an existing plan is marked
  `needs_refresh`, which the current-plan API exposes for a lightweight UI notice

Current merged behavior also includes:

- single-member trips do not treat budget ceiling as a group-blocking constraint
- blocked reasons are no longer always mislabeled as budget failures

## Trip city covers

- My Trips requests city covers through `backend/app/domain/trips/cover_service.py`; the browser
  never receives `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`
- a selected landscape result is persisted on `Trip` with photographer and Unsplash attribution
- successful covers are reused without another API search; unsuccessful provider attempts are
  retried only after seven days, while missing local key configuration is not negatively cached
- the current workspace is requested first, uses eager/high-priority image loading, and requests a
  1000×560 CDN rendition; Other Trips use native lazy loading and 360×220 renditions
- provider failure, unsafe/incomplete attribution, or no result leaves the existing neutral
  `Travel cover`; Trip covers never fall back to `Place.image_url` or `PlanItem.photo_url`

## Backend Behaviors Already Reflected In `New`

The local merged workspace already depends on these backend behaviors:

- account-backed users stay on `My Trips` when landing on workspace home
- guest-backed sessions still default into their trip
- vote rounds auto-settle once every member has voted
- self-only confirms can auto-apply immediately
- overlap-producing changes route into the correct decision path
- plan day dates are canonicalized from the trip window
- preference dates are validated against the trip date window
- item date moves update both `day_date` and `day_index`

## Key Endpoints

Representative endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/account`
- `GET /api/trips`
- `POST /api/trips`
- `GET /api/trips/{tripId}`
- `GET /api/trips/{tripId}/plans/current`
- `POST /api/trips/{tripId}/plans/generate`

- `PUT /api/trips/{tripId}/preferences/me`

- `GET /api/invites/{token}`
- `POST /api/invites/{token}/join`
- `POST /api/plans/items/{itemId}/classify`
- `POST /api/plans/items/{itemId}/changes`
- `GET /api/plans/{planId}/changes`
- `POST /api/updates/{noticeId}/object`
- `GET /api/rounds/{roundId}`
- `POST /api/rounds/{roundId}/votes`
- `POST /api/proposals/{proposalId}/decisions`
- `POST /api/trips/{tripId}/chat`

## Frontend Integration Rules

When wiring frontend to backend:

- do not read or write raw `tripsync:*` keys outside `shared/session-runtime/`
- do not assemble `Authorization`, `X-Trip-Id`, or `X-Membership-Id` headers manually
- do not reintroduce frontend-owned path classification
- treat `409` as a real pending-decision or conflict state, not a generic crash
- treat group-visible history as `PlanChange`-derived state
- keep Plan runtime state inside the frozen Plan feature boundary

## Remaining Backend Follow-Up

Still worth continuing after this merge:

- planner quality and real AI improvement
- richer invite/account binding flows
- migration tooling
- chat persistence if product direction requires it
- stronger route and travel-distance data
