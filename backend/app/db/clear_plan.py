"""Empty the demo trip's itinerary so `Generate` can be demonstrated.

Keeps the 6 members and their hard limits. Only the 9 plan items and the
decisions attached to them go away.

Why this exists: the seeded trip ships with an itinerary, so
POST /plans/generate correctly refuses with 409. A freshly created trip has
no members and no constraints, so generating there shows nothing interesting.
This gives you the one case worth demonstrating -- six people's hard limits
already in place, and the generator has to find a plan that clears all of them.
