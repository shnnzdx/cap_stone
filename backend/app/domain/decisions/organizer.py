"""The three things an organizer can do: remind, extend a round, break a deadlock.

The organizer is not a super user. All three maintain the shared frame; none of
them decides anything on another member's behalf:

  - a reminder nudges, it cannot fill the form in
  - an extension buys time, it cannot cast a vote
  - the deadlock exit never lets the organizer pick either side's proposal.
    They can keep the current block, split the block, or remove the disputed
    activity from the shared itinerary.

That last rule is the whole reason this module exists. Without an exit, a
confirmation that cannot reach agreement is a dead end; but handing the
organizer a tiebreaker would break "the organizer's preferences carry no
extra weight".
