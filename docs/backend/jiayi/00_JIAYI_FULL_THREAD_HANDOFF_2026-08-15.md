# Jiayi Full Thread Handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-15

## 1. Purpose

This folder records the work completed across Jiayi's recent Cadensy backend and Trip workspace iteration.

It is written as an agent handoff, not a product announcement. The goal is to help the next engineer understand what changed, which boundaries were intentionally preserved, and where to look before making follow-up changes.

## 3. High-Level Summary

The completed work focused on improving itinerary quality, place-data correctness, meal realism, Trip cover consistency, and Plan-page clarity without changing the current AI provider setup.

Current intended AI routing remains:

```text
Chat Agent      -> Ollama Cloud / qwen3.5
Planner Agent   -> DeepSeek / deepseek-v4-flash
Explainer Agent -> DeepSeek / deepseek-v4-flash
```

No new provider fallback was added.

## 4. Main Outcomes

Completed outcomes:

- Planner now treats candidate ids as the only selection authority.
- Backend resolves selected candidate ids back to Place cache names.
- Planner prompt now has clearer daily pacing, priority, meal, geography, and opening-hours rules.
- Meals are separated from sightseeing and do not count toward sightseeing activity count.
- Lunch and Dinner are separately labeled and preferentially use real food POIs.
- Meal selection is route-aware and has a bounded fallback ladder before flexible meal breaks.
- POI ranking was strengthened around clear names, travel relevance, category quality, address reliability, and spatial diversity.
- Preferences updates mark existing plans as needing refresh instead of silently rewriting Current Plan.
- Trip covers use backend-only Unsplash resolution and persisted Trip cover fields.
- Invite page now reuses the same Trip Cover source of truth as My Trips.
- Plan cards now use compact category or meal icons instead of activity photo placeholders.
- Chicago formal initial Plan generation now uses the same Place Service path as every other city.

## 5. Architecture Boundaries Preserved

The following boundaries were intentionally not redesigned:

- Session runtime
- Navigation policy
- PlanFeature public boundary
- Chat Agent provider routing
- Planner Agent provider routing
- Explainer Agent provider routing
- Trip Cover vs Place/PlanItem image separation
- Current Plan mutation policy

## 6. Important Warning

The repository had a large dirty working tree during this work. Many files were already modified before the final documentation pass.

Do not assume every changed file belongs to one small feature. Review by feature area and use the focused documents in this folder to understand which behavior each group protects.
