# Jiayi Frontend Change Summary

This folder documents the Trip workspace UI work completed in this pass.

The changes focus on the Trip workspace inside:

- `trip/src/final/FinalApp.jsx`
- `trip/src/final/plan-feature/PlanFeature.jsx`
- `trip/src/final/final.css`
- synced preview assets under `frontend/public/trip-app`

## Main Goal

Make the Trip workspace feel like one coherent Cadensy travel workspace instead of several unrelated dashboard-style pages.

The direction is:

- clean warm paper background
- muted navy brand identity
- editorial serif headings where appropriate
- quiet sans-serif metadata and controls
- subtle borders
- restrained shadows
- low-saturation surfaces
- practical, information-dense travel planning UI

## What Changed

1. Removed repeated Trip dashboard metadata from workspace pages.
2. Kept the global Header as the source of Trip identity.
3. Refined the Plan page summary, collaborator treatment, day modules, itinerary rows, timeline, map/sidebar surfaces, and row tinting.
4. Fixed map day tab interaction stability by keeping existing map selection state but preventing CSS/Leaflet layering from blocking clicks.
5. Fixed the Plan day-tab blank-page regression by restoring the missing route-mile helper used only in single-day map mode.
6. Fixed the Plan accordion regression where workspace-level CSS forced every day open and made the `+ / -` control appear broken.
7. Added a shared visual foundation across Plan, Chat, Updates, Preferences, Members, and Invite.
8. Synced the latest Trip preview build into `frontend/public/trip-app`.

## Why A UI Change Can Look "Unchanged"

There are two separate failure modes in this workspace:

1. `trip/src` changed, but `/trip` still renders the old embedded preview bundle.
2. A later high-specificity CSS override in `trip/src/final/final.css` visually cancels an existing interaction state.

The first issue is build-sync related. The second issue is CSS-state related.

### 1. Embedded Preview Sync

The standalone Trip app and the embedded `/trip` shell do not read from the same output at runtime.

- `trip/src/...` is the source of truth for Trip UI work
- `frontend/public/trip-app/...` is the built preview bundle that the main app actually embeds

That means a Trip UI fix is not guaranteed to appear in `/trip` until:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build:trip-preview
```

### 2. CSS Overrides Can Flatten Interaction States

This happened in the Plan accordion.

The base accordion logic was correct, but a later workspace-scoped CSS block overrode both:

- closed state styles
- open state styles

with the same visible result, so clicking `+ / -` looked broken even though the React state changed.

## Prevention Rule

When changing Trip UI in the future:

1. change source files under `trip/src/...`
2. rebuild the embedded preview with:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build:trip-preview
```

3. verify that any new CSS override preserves both default and `.open` or `.active` state selectors instead of flattening them into one visual state

## What Was Not Changed

The work intentionally avoids changes to:

- auth
- login
- profile bootstrap
- membership/session bootstrap
- localStorage keys
- `/trip` routing
- `/trip-app` routing
- iframe loading
- API requests
- backend
- database
- Planner Agent logic
- Chat Agent logic
- Apply / Vote / Confirm logic
- itinerary data structures
- map data structures
- Preferences fields
- Members logic
- Invite logic

## Design Principle

The UI should remain a functional travel workspace.

Editorial styling is expressed through typography, spacing, color, hierarchy, and restrained surfaces, not through oversized poster-like hero sections or decorative layouts.
