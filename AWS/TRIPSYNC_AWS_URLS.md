## Local AWS Operator Credential Source

On this machine, the local AWS CLI credential copy is stored in:

```text
backend/.env
```

Present key names verified on Thursday, August 13, 2026:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION
```

Important:

- the repo root `.env` is currently absent
- AWS CLI does not auto-read `backend/.env`
- a raw `aws sts get-caller-identity` can therefore return `NoCredentials`
  until the shell process imports those variables
- do not print or commit the credential values

PowerShell loader for the current shell only:

```powershell
Get-Content backend/.env | ForEach-Object {
  if ($_ -match '^\s*#' -or $_ -notmatch '=') { return }
  $name, $value = $_ -split '=', 2
  if ($name -in 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'AWS_SESSION_TOKEN', 'AWS_REGION', 'AWS_DEFAULT_REGION') {
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($name, $value, 'Process')
  }
}
```

Completed Phase 3-9 documents:

```

## Current Pause Point

HTTPS custom domain setup has been completed manually for:

```text
https://app.cadensy.top
```

The domain is registered and DNS-managed in Aliyun, not Route 53. See:

```text
AWS/CUSTOM_DOMAIN_HTTPS_RESULT.md
```

Do not blindly re-run `Phase 10 HTTPS Custom Domain` against
`app.cadensy.top`; the existing workflow assumes a Route 53 hosted zone and
future backend task definition updates must preserve the current AI runtime.

Cloud RDS remains private. Use `AWS/CLOUD_FIXED_ACCOUNTS_RUNBOOK.md` and the
manual `Cloud Fixed Accounts Upsert` workflow if the real database should
contain the fixed backend accounts:

```text
organizer@cadensy.local
participant@cadensy.local
```

Use `AWS/BACKEND_AI_RUNTIME_RUNBOOK.md` and the manual `Backend AI Runtime
Config` workflow if the deployed backend should stop using `MOCK_AI=1` and start
using a real OpenAI-compatible provider.

Historical-only demo cleanup notes are archived at:

```text
AWS/archive/CLOUD_DEMO_PURGE_RUNBOOK.md
```

Current backend AI runtime:

```text
MOCK_AI=0
CHAT_AI_PROVIDER=ollama_cloud
PLANNER_AI_PROVIDER=deepseek
EXPLAINER_AI_PROVIDER=deepseek
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
OLLAMA_CLOUD_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/v1/
OLLAMA_CLOUD_MODEL=qwen3.5:397b
```

Current backend non-AI provider secret expected in cloud runtime:

```text
GEOAPIFY_API_KEY -> /tripsync/backend/prod/geoapify-api-key
```

Current manual DeepSeek CLI operator guide:

```text
AWS/CLOUD_DEEPSEEK_CLI_RUNBOOK.md
```

Current manual dual-AI CLI operator guide:

```text
AWS/CLOUD_DUAL_AI_CLI_RUNBOOK.md
```

Cloud branch policy:

```text
Only main may deploy to or mutate the live AWS environment.
All current manual cloud workflows hard-fail when dispatched from any branch other than main.
```

## Cost Reminder

The live proof can incur charges while running.

Main cost drivers:

```text
ALB hourly charge
Fargate task runtime
public IPv4 addresses
CloudWatch Logs usage
ECR image storage
RDS runtime/storage if left active
Route 53 hosted zone if created later
```

Use the cleanup order in `AWS/archive/completed-phases/PHASE5_BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` when the proof is no longer needed.
